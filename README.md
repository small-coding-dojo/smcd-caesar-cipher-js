## The Mob Session Itself

* Clarify the roles ``driver``, ``navigator`` and ``consultants``
* Choose a kata
* Set up a basic cycling timer
* Get dirty :)

    Repeat:
    * run ``mob start`` to start a round,
    * do some coding, 
    * run ``mob next`` for a hand over when the cycle timer tells you to.

    Finish with your session ``mob done`` and a corresponding meaningful commit message

* Make sure to do a debriefing at the end of or after the session.
